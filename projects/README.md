## Previous project: Bayesian Social Media Meter

 Create a daemonized Linux process that scrapes and stores twitter, reddit and quora data in a  PostgreSQL database. Perform Bayesian sentiment analysis on the two data sources. 

```
P( TwitterSentiment | QuoraSentiment) = P(QS | TS) P(TS) / P(QS)
```
